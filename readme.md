# Boise Codeworks: Trivia

The purpose of this project was to learn how to successfully pull and parse data from an API. I created a form to retrieve an amount of questions (maximum is 50; enforced by the API) and display them on the page with their answers as buttons.

The API can send out two formats of trivias: true/false trivias or multiple question trivias. I coded my program to handle both situations. When a button is clicked, the user is alerted as to whether they were correct or not.
